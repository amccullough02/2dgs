# 2DGS
2DGS is an open-source **2D Gravity Simulator**. The application was designed to provide a hands-on demonstration of
classical mechanics through the lens of orbital mechanics and was envisioned as an educational tool.

This project was built for my final year in Ulster University, so bear in mind that this is still the code of an
intermediate programmer at best.
## Quick Start Tutorial
N.B. A more detailed tutorial is planned in the future!
1. Select 'Browse Simulations.'
2. You will be taken to the Simulation Menu.
3. Select the lesson titled 'Three Body Problem'.
4. In the top-right corner, select 'Show Lesson Prompt'.
5. The lesson prompt will now appear. The prompt will guide you through a concept in orbital mechanics ending with a guided practical.
6. Upon completing the lesson click 'Reset Simulation' if you want to give it another go.
7. Otherwise, select 'Exit Simulation' to return to the Main Menu.
