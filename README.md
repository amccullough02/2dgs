# 2DGS
## About
2DGS is an open-source **2D Gravity Simulator**. The application was designed to provide a hands-on demonstration of 
classical mechanics through the lens of orbital mechanics and was envisioned as an educational tool. 

This project was built for my final year in Ulster University, so bear in mind that this is still the code of an 
intermediate programmer at best.
